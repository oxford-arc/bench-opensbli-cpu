# OpenSBLI

To aid with standardisation across UK HPC systems, our OpenSBLI benchmark is identical to the "LARGE (1024)" one used by ARCHER, the UK national HPC service.

Details of how to build and run the benchmark may be found in the ARCHER repository here: https://github.com/hpc-uk/archer-benchmarks/tree/master/apps/OpenSBLI
